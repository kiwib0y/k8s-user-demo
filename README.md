# Configuration

This kubernetes configuration is used to demonstrate how an application
and a persistent volume can deployed.

## Basics

We are just going to apply each of the files. Make sure you have kubectl installed.
Also, make sure you have set the correct context. You don't want to waste any money.

## Installation

`kubectl apply -f <filename>`

You might want to create some secrets beforehand for this part.

Any additional things will depend on the type of cluster you have chosen.
